# Stock Market Prediction

## Introduction

Stock market forecasting is a technique for predicting the direction of the stock market and estimating the value of a stock or other financial asset in the future. 
90 percent of the worldâ€™s data has been generated in the last few years as a result of the daily generation of 2.5 quintillion bytes of data. The financial market generates a significant amount of data. Recognizing a pattern and then devising an ideal method for making judgments is extremely tough for a trader. 
One of the most difficult things to accomplish is to predict how the stock market will perform. It is critical to develop a system that will function with optimum precision and take into account all key elements that may impact the outcome. 

## Problem Definition

Every day, the stock market is mentioned in the news. Every time it achieves a new high or low, you hear about it. 
If an effective algorithm could be established to anticipate the short term price of an individual stock, the rate of investment and business prospects in the stock market may increase. 
So in this project we will do a comparative study of various machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree and LSTM Neural Network for efficient stock market prediction.


## Dataset Description

A dataset is taken from Amazon dated 04-01-2010 to 31-12-2020. This dataset attribute is open, high, low, close and volume but we selected close as a label data and the rest of to extract the features that will help to predict the result.
